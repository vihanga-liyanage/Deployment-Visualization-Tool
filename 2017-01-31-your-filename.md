# WSO2 Deployment Visualizer
##Introduction

The basic idea of WSO2 Deployment Visualizer is to create a visual tool where you can draw a deployment pattern and generate the relevant configuration files automatically, as well as when you provide a set of configuration files, generate the relevant visual graph.
Phase 1 of this project concentrate on generating a docker configurations folder that can deploy instantly to a particular deployment pattern. In the context of phase 1, project is based on the deployment patterns of WSO2 API Manager provided [here](https://github.com/wso2/docker-apim/tree/master/docker-compose).
